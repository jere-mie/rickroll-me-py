# Rickroll Me
#### (Custom Metadata URL Redirect Prank)

## Inspiration
I took two of the things I love, **Rickrolls/pranks**, and **URL redirecting**, and decided to make an app that **automated the process** of bringing the two together. I have in the past used one specific repl that I had to manually edit the code in any time I wanted to make a different prank, and knew there must be a better way. That is when I decided to make this app.

## What it does
This web app **takes input from the user** of how the URL should look, and different **metadata tags** (*site name, title, description, and image*) and creates a redirect link. It stores this information in a **SQL database** so that old links can be used in the future. When someone pastes the link, **the website will appear just as they set up with the metadata**, and when they click on the link, it **redirects to a Rickroll**.
